        Evaluate if dependency listing is correct or not

        Determines the package manager employed by the user to specify
        application dependencies, setting up the appropriate interaction
        classes used to query one of the various package managers available
        as the system resolves dependency versions. Should no requirement file
        exist which specifies needed libraries+versions, this method provides
        the logic through which users are asked to select how they would like
        to proceed - automatic heuristic based generation or manual.

        Parameters
        ----------
        do_diff_check: bool
            Check for the diff between requirements file and the environment. This
            is True by default but `serialize_dependencies` checks this explicitly
            as part of serializing the dependencies and hence will set as False
        ignore_warnings: bool
            Should warnings be ignored. Should be removed when we move
            click component out of SDK -> TODO
